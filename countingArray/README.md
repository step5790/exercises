Create a program that counts in the console. Like seen above, but with a new line at every count. (The animation only shows the last line) 

Every second, the counter increments by one. The counter is then added to the beginning of an array. The array is “truncated” so that it never becomes longer than 9.

The array is logged to the console. The program doesn’t do anything else. 

Design
You should only need two variables, the counter and the array. Only one of them should be a let variable.

You should only need one function, but you might benefit from using the init-loop pattern.

Recommended procedure
Follow these steps one at a time. Don't try to solve the entire solution at once, but start with step 1, and make sure that works, before continuing with the next step, and so forth.

Make a program that counts (with a timed delay)

Modify the program to insert the counter-value in the beginning of the array

Modify the program again, to make sure the array doesn’t get longer than nine items.

Hand-in details
How
Make sure you have an HTML and a JS file.

Commit and push both to GitHub, and create a github-page.

Paste the link to that github-page as the answer to this assignment - make sure it is clickable!
